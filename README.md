# ChatGPT Mobile

## Overview

Chat with ChatGPT, the latest and greatest in AI technology! This is a platform agnostic, React Native application that allows the user to have a chat with ChatGPT on their mobile Android or iOS device. 

It is an improvement to the online version because the user doesn't need to use a browser, or login to any account. Simply open up the app, and start chatting with ChatGPT!

The app also features context retention, so ChatGPT will remember your earlier messages, and respond accordingly. Just as a regular person would in conversation.
